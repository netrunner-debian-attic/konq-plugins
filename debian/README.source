Package konq-plugins
--------------------

For the moment, there is no extragear/konq-plugins official release
tarballs. You can get the source from the KDE svn, using preferably
the svn_get script available at :
svn.debian.org/pkg-kde/kde-extras/konq-plugins/trunk/svn_get

This package uses cdbs and quilt.
